### Regression - Polynomial Fitting ###
Experiment involved:-
* Fitting polynomial of degree “d” to the noisy data.
* Computing the bias and variance for the models fitted.
* Plotting the bias-variance against model complexity(Guassian noise).
* Plotting the bias and variance as a function of sigma.

### Exponential distribution in R ###
<b> Goal : </b> Here we investigate the exponential distribution (1 dimensional)
in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution
can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter.
The mean of the exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is
also 1/lambda. By Setting different lambda all of the simulations. We investigated the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials.
Worked on thousand simulations.
